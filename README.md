# -Gate-fee-Calculator
This repo  helps you generate the discount  you are awarded based on age gap and displays how much you are to pay.
  - I used the print function to display information about the ages and the discount allocated to each age group.
  - I use the input function to enable user enter their age.
  - I made use of various variable to aid data storage.
  - I made use of the conditional statement (if, elif, else) to assign discount and price to age
